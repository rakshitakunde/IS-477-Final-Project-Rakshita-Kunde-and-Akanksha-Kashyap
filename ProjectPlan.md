Overall Goal: The goal of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end data curation and analysis system that showcases the full data lifecycle, from acquiring the data to producing insightful results, of our two chosen datasets. We will be collecting, organizing, cleaning, and integrating the data using the appropriate tools and skills learned during lecture and the coursework. We will also be applying concepts, such as ethical data handling, data quality assessment, workflow automation, and reproducibility to show how we treat the datasets and arrive at our conclusions. We intend to use our data to show insights into real-world issues and events that showcase current gaps within society. 

Research Questions:

Team: Regarding our team member roles and responsibilities, both Rakshita Kunde and Akanksha Kashyap will work on all parts of the final project, splitting the responsibilities evenly. We will work on each part together to have effective collaboration in all aspects.

Datasets:

Timeline: hi

Constraints: To create this project, there are several limitations and conditions that may affect how we collect, process, and analyze our datasets. First, the Crimes dataset covers incidents from 2001 onwards, however the Violence Reduction dataset includes victim-level records for homicides from 1991 to present and from 2010 onwards for shootings. The timeframes overlap but arenâ€™t identical. Secondly, the crimes dataset records incidents while the Violence Reduction dataset records victims. Thirdly, both datasets are public, but they both involve sensitive information about crimes and victims. The data must be handled ethically in a way that avoid identification and stigmatization. Visualizations also must not expose individual-level locations without aggregation. Next, both datasets are updated daily and historical records may change upon new available information. Our interpretations may not be consistent over time. Additionally, the Crimes dataset has over 8 million rows, making it difficult to analyze all of the data. Finally, the two datasets use different naming conventions and have different data types and formatting.
