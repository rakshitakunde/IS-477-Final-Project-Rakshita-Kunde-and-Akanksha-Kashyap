Overall Goal: The goal of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end data curation and analysis system that showcases the full data lifecycle, from acquiring the data to producing insightful results, of our two chosen datasets. We will be collecting, organizing, cleaning, and integrating the data using the appropriate tools and skills learned during lecture and the coursework. We will also be applying concepts, such as ethical data handling, data quality assessment, workflow automation, and reproducibility to show how we treat the datasets and arrive at our conclusions. We intend to use our data to show insights into real-world issues and events that showcase current gaps within society.
